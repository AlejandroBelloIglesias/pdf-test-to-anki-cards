# pdf-test-to-anki-cards
A tiny html-javascript script that formats the plain copied text from a PDF into a well formated text (.txt) that anki can recognize as separated questions.

ANSWERS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE "BACK" OF ANKI. (Can't copy highlighted or bold text into plain text)

You'll probably need to check the output text so it is correctly formatted.
Try to avoid numbers followed by ". " or ".\n" if they aren't new answeres.

For example "The answer is Sars-CoV-2\n" instead of "The answer is Sars-CoV-2.\n"
